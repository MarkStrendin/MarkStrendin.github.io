<h1>Ridley's Pack</h1>
<b><a href="RidleyPack-3.0.zip">Click to download modpack profile (v3.0 - December 11 2020)</a></b>
<br/><br/>
<b>Version 3 - December 11, 2020</b>. This version is based on <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-the-mods-6">AllTheMods 6</a>, with some tweaks and additions.
<br/><br/>
<h3>How to Import this modpack</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Install GDLauncher - <a href="https://gdevs.io/">https://gdevs.io/</a></li>
	<li>Download the Zip file linked above, and remember where you saved it</li>
	<li>In GDLauncher, click the plus sign in the bottom-left corner</li>
	<li>Give it the zip file that you downloaded in step 2</li>
	<li>Wait for it to download the mods</li>
	<li>The modpack should show up in the GDLauncher menu. Click it to launch it.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>It may take 10-15 minutes to fully load, depending on your computer</li>
		<li>It may appear to freeze or hang. Just leave it be and it should eventually come out of it. This is normal.</li>
	</ul>
</ol>
<br/><br/>
<h3>Adjusting your Java RAM</h3>
<p>If you experience crashes while loading, or regular freezes at time intervals (like every few seconds for example), you may need to adjust the amount of RAM that Minecraft can use.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Open GDLauncher.</li>
	<li>Click the "Gear" icon in the top-right corner of GDLauncher.</li>
	<li>On the left, click Java.</li>
	<li>Find the section labelled Java Memory.</li>
	<li>Use the slider to adjust the amount of RAM Java is allowed to use.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>There is no "right" ammount, because this depends on how much RAM your system has.</li>
		<li>I recommend setting it around 8000, if your system has this much RAM.</li>
		<li>If you have more than 8GB of RAM, you don't need to set this all the way to the right.
	</ul>
	<li>Changes are automatically saved, so click the "X" in the top-right to exit settings (the lower "X", not the one for the whole program.)</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
<h3>What's the server address?</h3>
<p>Its a private server, so I don't give that out here. Ask someone who already knows for the connection info.</p>
