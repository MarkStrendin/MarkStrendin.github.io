            I make a custom modpack for the modded (Forge) server that I host. The server is <i>not</i> public, but the modpack is a standard CurseForge format modpack, and you are free to play it or set up your own server if you wish.

        <h2>Mark's Minecraft Guides</h2>
        <p>Minecraft related guides and articles, mostly explaining how I automated something (so I can look when I forget).</p>
        <p>Any guide here may be out of date compared to current versions of Minecraft or the mods used, so I make no promises that these will work for you. If they don't work, they might still get you close. The methods explained in these articles may not be the most efficient way to accomplish their goals, they are simply the way that I was doing them when I decided to write these articles - there may be reasons I did or didn't do things a certain way.</p>
