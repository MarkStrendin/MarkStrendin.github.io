		<h1>Automating the Runic Altar with Applied Energistics, Modular Routers, and Integrated Dynamics</h1>

		<p>
            This article describes how I automated the Botania Runic Altar with Applied Energistics, Modular Routers, and Integrated Dynamics. There are certainly other ways to automate this (including using no additional mods outside of Botania), but this is how I did it.
        </p>
        <p>
            This design has been through many iterations, and this is the one that seems to work best. Previous iterations that involved dropping all of the items from a Botania Open Crate were causing issues with many disappearing ingredients that cause the crafting job to get stuck, and this new design seems to solve those issues, so I am documenting it.
        </p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>A: Botania Runic Altar</b> (the thing we are automating)</li>
                <li><b>B: "Placer" Modular Router</b>. This one places ingredients on the altar, and places the final Living Stone block. By having it "right click" the blocks into the altar, instead of using a dropper or Botania Open Crate, we can more easily "vacuum" up the final crafted rune without worrying that any ingredients from the <i>next</i> craft might get vacuumed up, which would break the craft and leave the system in a broken state.</li>
                <li><b>C: "Wand" Modular Router</b>. This one right clicks the Runic Altar with a Wand of the Forest when the crafted rune is ready.</li>
                <li><b>D: "Distributor" Modular Router</b>. This one passes items to <b>Modular Router B</b> to place on the altar, ensuring that Living Stone is kept behind until the altar is ready. It's possible to make this setup without this extra Modular Router, but this ensures that if it happens to take more than 5 minutes to charge the altar with mana, the Living Stone won't despawn, because it's only added when needed.</li>
                <li><b>E: "Vacuum" Modular Router</b>. This one "vacuums" up the newly crafted rune, as well as any runes that were used as ingredients but were not consumed.
                <li><b>F: Integrated Dynamics Variable Store.</b></li>
                <li><b>G: Integrated Dynamics Redstone Writer</b>. Pointed at the bottom side of <b>C: "Wand" Modular Router</b>, this one lets the "Wand" modular router know when the Runic Altar is finished crafting, and is ready to be right clicked with a Wand of the Forest.</li>

                <li><b>L: Chest</b>. This is where the raw ingredients are deposited by the Applied Energistics system.</li>
                <li><b>M: Applied Energistics Pattern Provider</b>. This allows an Applied Energistics system to auto-craft. It holds the pattern for the rune, and it deposits the ingredients into the chest when a craft is triggered. It is set to lock until the completed item is returned, to ensure that only one item at a time is crafted - this allows the system to work for <i>any</i>rune without extra fiddling.</li>

        <p>Just a Runic Altar. There is nothing to configure here, so this section will be very brief. Make sure that while you are building this setup that stray items don't drop on it, or it will pick them up and it might be difficult to tell that your setup is broken (especially if it's something barely visible like Mana Glass)</p>
        <p>The Runic Altar will require a <b>Mana Spreader</b> be pointed at it to provide it Mana from a <b>Mana Pool</b>. These are not pictured in the images in this article, and setting them up is beyond the scope of this article - read the <b>Lexica Botania</b> in-game for more information on how to make a Runic Altar work.</p>


        <br/>
        <h3 id="Part_B">B: "Placer" Modular Router (left side)</h3>
        <div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">

            This Modular Router places the ingredients onto the Runic Altar. It receives items from another Modular Router, so it doesn't need to worry about pulling items from anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>This Modular Router is set to <b>Redstone: High</b>, so that it only functions when it receives a redstone signal.</li>
                <li>Eco-Mode is not necessary (but will help reduce lag on a server, so it's a good idea to turn it on)</li>
                <li>This Modular Router contains two modules:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>An <b>Activator Module</b>, which "right clicks" ingredients into the Runic Altar.</li>
                    <li>A <b>Dropper Module</b>, which drops the final Living Stone at the end, which needs to be dropped into the world rather than right-clicked in.
                </ul>
                <li>The 9 Speed Upgrades in the example image are not required (they just make it work faster).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            By using an Activator Module to deliver ingredients to the Runic Altar, we reduce the number of items that are ever dropped into the world, which can create lag and can cause issues if items disappear "in flight" due to server mods, villagers eating food items, players with "magnet" type equipment, etc. My setup is in an active village, so dropped food items often disappear, and this helped avoid this issue.
        </p>

        <h4>Modules in "B" Modular Router</h4>

        <h5 id="Part_B_1">Activator Module ("B" Modular Router)</h5>
        <p>
            <div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
                <img src="MR_Left_module_activator.png" style="max-width: 50%;"/>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>Is in <b>Blacklist</b> mode, with <b>Living Stone</b> in the blacklist.</li>
                <li>Is set with the default right-click action and settings - no changes needed from the defaults.</li>
                <li>Has it's direction set towards the Runic Altar (to the right, if you are building it exactly like the images in this article)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h5 id="Part_B_2">Dropper Module ("B" Modular Router)</h5>
        <div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
            <img src="MR_Left_Module_dropper.png" style="max-width: 50%;"/>

        <p>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            This is how we "Right click" all of the other ingredients in, but "drop" the Living Stone - Living Stone is ignored by the Activator Module, but is the focus of this Dropper Module.

                    <li>A <b>Sender Module Mk2</b>, which sends anything this Modular Router picks up to the "Placer" "B" Modular Router.</li>                    
                </ul>
                <li>The <b>Speed Augments</b> pictured are optional - they just make it go faster.</li>

        <p>
            This Modular Router picks up the crafted runes once they are complete. The Runic Altar will drop them into the world around itself, so a "Vacuum" capability is required.
        </p>
        <p>You could easily replace this with a HopperHock, or any other vacuum chest, or other mechanism to pick up dropped items (Rats, Golems, etc). You'll want to blacklist Living Stone, so you don't pick up the final Living Stone that must be dropped onto the Runic Alter to finish the crafting process.</p>
        <p>
            This Modular Router has two modules:
            <ul>
                <li>A <b>Vacuum Module</b> to pick up dropped items</li>
                <li>A <b>Sender Mk2 Module</b> to send the picked up items back to the AE2 system (or wherever you want the end result items to go)</li>
             </ul>
             You can optionally add up to 9 <b>Speed Upgrades</b> and a <b>stack upgrade</b> or two, to ensure it picks up the dropped items in a timely manner. In the image I have 3 stack upgrades - this is overkill.

        <p>
            The <b>Tag Filter</b> should be configured with the tag <code>botania:runes</code>. To do this, craft a rune manually, then craft a new <b>tag filter</b>. Right click the tag filter and put the rune in the slot at the top. Use the dropdown box to select <code>botania:runes</code>, then click the "+" button to add that tag to the list. Do not select the <code>mythicbotany:runes</code> one you might see (if you also have Mythic Botany installed), because this will cause the system to fail to pick up normal Botania runes (<code>botania:runes</code> will include MythicBotany runes as well)

            This sends any picked up item back to your base's inventory - in my case, to the Applied Energistics 2 Pattern Provider, which will automatically insert the items back into storage.

                <li>With this module in your hand, shift+right click the block where you want the final crafted rune to be sent to. In  my case, this is the <b>Pattern Provider</b>.
                <li><b>DO NOT SEND ITEMS BACK TO THE INPUT CHEST!</b> This will cause them to get re-imported into the Runic Altar, and it will break until you manually clean out the items from the Runic Alter. If you are not sending back to an AE2 system like I am, send the output to a <i>different</i> chest, or some other storage.</li>

            You'll want to place all the blocks before you start collecting variables to put in here. There is a section below that explains what that means, if you have never used Integrated Dynamics before.
        </p>
        <p>
            The variables we'll <i>eventually</i> have in here are:
            <ul>
                <li>An <b>Integer</b> of <b>0</b> (zero)</li>
                <li>An <b>Integer</b> of <b>2</b> (two)</li>

        <p>The "Part ID" and "Variable ID" values in the screenshot are not important, your numbers will be different than mine were.</p>
        <p>The positioning of the variables in the Variable Store do not matter at all.</p>

        <h4>How to collect the correct variable cards while you build</h4>
        <p>Don't try to set up variable cards while you build - place down all of the blocks and make sure they are in the correct spots, <i>then</i> come back and set up the variable cards.</p>
        <p>If you move any of the Integrated Dynamics blocks (including the cables), it may break your variables, and you may need to set them up again.

            This Redstone Writer provides a signal to the "Placer" "B" Modular Router, allowing it to use it's Activator Module to insert an item into the Runic Altar. Without this, the Modular Router will constantly right click the Runic Altar, and if the Modular Router doesn't have an item in it's inventory, it will take an item off of the altar, potentially ruining a craft in progress, and causing the whole system to get stuck in a loop. The signal that triggers this Redstone Writer is the comparator on the back side of it (component "J"), which checks to see if there are any items in the Modular Router's inventory slot. It will only allow it to right click the Runic Altar if it has an item in it's inventory, ensuring that the items can only flow in one direction - onto the Runic Altar.

        </p>
        <p>
            When <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Redstone_Comparator">comparators</a> are attached to a block with an inventory, like chests, they emit a signal depending on how many items are in the inventory - or how "full" the inventory is. 
            <br/>
            Some potential comparator values for a block with inventory:
            <ul>
                <li><b>0:</b> The inventory is empty.</li>
                <li><b>1-14:</b> The inventory has items in it. The signal strength represents how full the inventory is, with 1 being the least full, and 14 being <i>almost</i> full. The exact values will differ depending on the type of block the comparator is attached to.</li>
                <li><b>15:</b> The inventory is 100% full.</li>
             </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Modular Router that this Redstone Reader is attached to needs to use it's <b>Activator Module</b> to place blocks onto the Runic Altar. The "Activator" module isn't aware that it's putting items on the Runic Altar, it's just blindly right clicking, and right clicking a Runic Altar with an "empty" hand (or empty inventory in the Modular Router in this case) will pull an item <i>off</i> of the Runic Altar, which we don't want. We want the Modular Router to only right click the Runic Altar if it has an item in it's inventory, and to not do any right clicking if it doesn't have any items. The Activator module can't do this logic on it's own, so we need a Redstone Reader and a Redstone Writer to tell it when it's OK to right click.

            This Redstone Reader is configured as a <b>comparator</b>, attached to the bottom side of the <b>Runic Altar</b>. <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Redstone_Comparator">Comparators</a> receive signals from "machines" and complex blocks that mean different things depending on the block that they are attached to. In this case, signals we can expect from a Runic Altar are:
            <ul>
                <li><b>0:</b> The Runic Altar is idle, not currently crafting anything</li>
                <li><b>1:</b> The Runic Altar has items in it and is actively crafting an item. Mana should be flowing into the Runic Altar at this point.</li>
                <li><b>2:</b> The Runic Altar has received enough mana to finish the craft, and is now waiting for the final Living Stone block to be dropped onto it, and to be right clicked with a Wand of the Forest. A larger blue lightning bolt should be coming out from the Runic Altar at this point.</li>
            </ul>
            The Integrated Dynamics Redstone Reader is capable of detecting what a comparator would be emitting, and allows us to use that information elsewhere with any other Integrated Dynamics component connected with Logic Cables.

        <p>
            Just a normal pattern provider, which as of the version of Applied Energistics I'm using, is the standard way for an AE system to provide crafting ingredients for auto-crafting jobs. If you are not familiar with Applied Energistics, this block contains a "pattern" for each type of item it can craft, and it provides the ingredients for any requested items into the chest.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pattern provider delivers ingredients to an adjacent inventory, so it must be touching the chest. The positioning of the chest and Pattern Provider don't matter, as long as they are within 12 blocks of the "Distributor" "D" Modular Router (up to 24 with range upgrades).
        </p>
        <div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
            <img src="ME_PatternProvider_02.png" style="max-width: 50%;"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            You will want to set it to <b>Lock until primary crafting result is returned</b>. This can be done by clicking into the Pattern Provider's interface and using the small buttons on the left edge. This setting ensure that the AE system only deposits the ingredients for one item at a time, and won't deposit any more until it receives the crafted item back and knows that it's finished.
        </p>
        <p>
            Make sure your AE system is capable of auto-crafting, with at least one <b>Crafting CPU</b>. See the <a href="https://guide.appliedenergistics.org">Applied Energistics Guide</a> if you need help setting this up.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are not using Applied Energistics, you will need to find a way to insert the ingredients for exactly 1 (one) rune at a time into the chest "L". You can probably do this with mods similar to Applied Energistics, such as Refined Storage, but since I am an Applied Energistics user, I am not familiar with other mods that do the same thing.

        <h2 id="Variables"><a name="IDVARIABLES"></a>How to get the Integrated Dynamics variables</h2> 
        <div style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid rgba(0,128,255,1); background-color: rgba(0,128,255,0.1); margin: 5px; border-radius: 10px;">
            If you've messed up and set the variable card to the wrong thing, just close the Integrated Dynamics GUI, open your inventory, and place the card in your 2x2 crafting grid by itself. You can then pull out a "reset" variable card from the crafting results slot, and you can now try again.
        </div>
        <p>
            This section walks you through setting up the Integrated Dynamics variable cards from start to finish.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This can get complicated, so take your time.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Oopsie">How to recover if you've messed up</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Put all variable cards from all Integrated Dynamics components (including the Variable Store) into your inventory</li>
                <li>One by one, put them in your inventory's 2x2 crafting grid, and take out the "crafted" results. This resets the variable cards to default so you can set them up again.</li>
                <li>Start this section again. Make sure you label as you go to help reduce any confusion.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Required items</h3>
        <p>
            You will need:
            <ul>
                <li>7 blank Variable Cards</li>
                <li>1 Logic Programmer or Portable Logic Programmer (it doesn't matter which)</li>
                <li>1 Labeller, to label variable cards so you know which one is which</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Setting up your variable cards</h3>

        <p>            
            <ul>
                <li>With the variable cards in your inventory, find the Redstone Reader "K" under the Runic Altar and click into it to open it's GUI/interface</li>
                <li>Scroll down the list until you see <b>Comparator</b> (which is likely at the very bottom).</li>                
            </ul>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Put 1 blank <b>Variable Card</b> into the <b>Left</b> slot, in the <b>Comparator</b> section</li>
                <li>The card will immediately move to the right slot, and it will change to indicate that it is now bound to the comparator value of this Redstone Reader.</li>
                <li>Take the variable card and use your <b>Labeller</b> to label it <code>Runic Altar Comparator</code></li>
                <li>Now find the Redstone Reader "J", attached to the back of the "Placer" Modular Router (component "B"), and open it's UI.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            This setup can be fairly easily hidden underground, with the two above-ground Modular Routers using camouflage upgrades to hide as whatever block makes sense (in the example image they are mossy cobblestone stairs, specifically a corner piece, to hide the Integrated Dynamics Redstone Reader on the back of them).
        </p>
        <p>
            This setup is fairly compact, and can be easily scaled out to as many as you want. I use 4 of these, each with different runes that it has the patterns for so that it can make multiple runes at the same time.
